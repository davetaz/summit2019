<h4>
Good morning and welcome to the first parallel session at the ODI Summit 2019.
</h4>
<h4>
My name is Dr David Tarrant, and I’m the senior leading advisor at the Open Data Institute. It is my job to help bring the best data training programmes to organisations to help them get the most from data while managing harmful impacts.
</h4>
<h4>
Our focus is on changing the behaviour of individuals in their roles as stewards, creators and decision-makers.
</h4>
<h4>
Our programmes focus on the benefits of openness that help overcome data hoarding tendencies, this helps organisations to innovate faster and enables everyone to get access to the right data at the right time. We also tackle the fears people have in using data through programmes that focus on ethics, equity and engagement.
</h4>
<h4>
To do this we partner with leaders to build a culture of openness and trust around data, by helping them identify then develop the practical skills, advice, tools and networks they require. As an independent, non-profit organisation the ODI helps them take a holistic view of what they need, in order to deliver long-term change. 
</h4>
<h4>
The ODI Data Skills Framework is one of the key tools our partners use to get started. It is the basis for making  better decisions about where and how to build capacity and capability.
</h4>
<h4>
The Data Skills Framework provides our partners with a holistic view of data skills by breaking the domain into topics and showing how these topics connect. This makes it easier to understand where to start, and where to focus.
</h4>
<h4>
The skills framework is split into themes (shown by the colours). 
</h4>
<h4>
It is also balanced in two key skills areas. Strategic and Practitioner. 
</h4>
<h4>
Balance is critically important. For example, a focus on governance and a risk averse approach will stifle analysis and innovation. Conversely, innovation without ethics can lead to loss of trust. To get the most from data we believe everyone is data person. But this doesn’t mean everyone needs to be a data scientist! 
</h4>
<h4>
In fact we believe that data scientists, those specialist practitioners with even deeper and more impenetrable knowledge emphasize the already huge gaps that exist between practitioners and strategists. 
</h4>
<h4>
We use the data skills framework to help break down those silos.
